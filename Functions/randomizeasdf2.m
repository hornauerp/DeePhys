%% RANDOMIZEASDF2 - randomize asdf2 spike data to produce a null model
% Algorithm for randomizing spiking data in the asdf2 format using a
% specified method. This randomized data can be used as a null model
% version of the data in any given analysis.
%
% Syntax: [randasdf2] = randomizeasdf2(asdf2, method, varargin)
%
% Input:
%   asdf2 (structure array) - contains time raster and other information
%   method (string) - specifies the randomization method used. Choices:
%     'wrap' - cuts each spike train at random time (different for each
%         train) and swaps the resulting pieces. This method nearly
%         preserves the ISI distribution for each neuron, but completely
%         disrupts interneuron temporal relationships. 
%     'jitter' - randomly alters each spike time using a Gaussian
%         distribution centered on the original spike time. The user can
%         set the standard deviation of Gaussian distribution. This method
%         nearly preserves the ISI distribution for each neuron and all
%         neurons considered together. Also, it preserves interneuron
%         temporal relationships to a certain extent, dependent upon the
%         standard deviation of the jittering distribution. Importantly,
%         this method preserves the overall spike count (i.e. no spikes are
%         jittered into eachother). 
%     'Poisson' - converts each neuron's spike raster to a Poisson
%         spiking neuron with number of spikes and firing rate conserved.
%     'swap' - spike swaps each spike at least once. This preserves the
%         firing rate of each neuron and the instantaneous network wide
%         firing rate. Also, it preserves basic avalanche properties like
%         the size, duration, and shape of each avalanche.
%     'swap2' - spike swaps each spike, but does not preserve individual
%         neuron firing rates. This preserves the instantaneous network
%         firing rate (and therefore basic avalanche properties), but it
%         does not preserve individual neuron firing rates.
%
%
% Variable Inputs:
%   (..., 'stdtime', stdev) - the standard deviation of spike jittering in 
%     ms if the method is selected (scalar double) (default: 10 ms).
%   (..., 'stdbin', stdev) - the standard deviation of spike jittering in
%     bins if the method is selected (scalar double: integer) (default:
%     jittering stdev is set such that it is 10 ms).
%     
%
% Outputs:
%   randasdf2 (structure array) - contains time raster and other
%     information for the randomized spiking data. Also, a new field is
%     added describing the randomization that was used.
%
% Example:
%   randasdf2 = randomizeasdf2(asdf2,'jitter','stdtime',20);
%     % jitter the spike times in asdf2 using a Gaussian distribution with
%     % a standard deviation of 20 ms.
%   randasdf2 = randomizeasdf2(asdf2,'wrap');
%     % cut each neuron's spike train at a random point (different for each
%     % neuron) and swap the remaining pieces of the spike train.
